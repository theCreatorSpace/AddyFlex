Currently I am making a future prediction on how USDCAD will go, and what I am planning to do with my trade. I will await for the signal to create a support level at its entry point near 1.29600 before a long position will be placed. My stop loss would be approx. 1.29150 (This will depend how the signal goes at that time, it may vary) The ideal take profit would be 1.316000 resistance level . Lets wait and see what the signal gives when the trend gets near 1.29600 ish .' ,
